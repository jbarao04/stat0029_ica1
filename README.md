# STAT0029: Statistical Design of Investigations
# Assignment 1

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation that underpins techniques in
statistics, econometrics and machine learning. As data dimension grows, the com-
putational cost of this operation becomes of increasing practical concern. This arti-
cle investigates how the runtime of matrix multiplications depends on both the algo-
rithm used and the language in which it is implemented. We conduct a balanced ran-
domized experiment comparing four matrix multiplication algorithms across three
programming languages, with language treated as a blocking factor. Our two-way
ANOVA analysis reveals that both algorithm and language significantly affect run-
time, and that while performance depends on the programming language, optimised
implementations perform best in practice.
